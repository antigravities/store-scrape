# Search Scrape
Turns Steam search results for items on sale into a nice pastable text blob.

Created for /r/Steam's Summer Sale spreadsheet.

## How do?
First, get a userscript manager like [Greasemonkey (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Tampermonkey (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo). Then, import the userscript by clicking [here](https://github.com/antigravities/store-scrape/raw/master/searchscrape.user.js). You can then search for a term, and you'll see a button on the right that says "Store Scrape" that you should click.

## Format
Title | Discount | Original Price | Discounted Price | Release Date (m/d/yyyy) | Rating | Windows | Mac | Linux | VR | TC | Bundled on Steam | Store Page
